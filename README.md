This is a school project please ignore this

To run the project:
1. clone the repository or download everything into a directory
2. run main.py (in the directory)

"laptop.db" already has the database structure and every laptop. But if you want to drop and reinsert the data:
1. run backend.py (in the directory)

yes the dataset I got from kaggle is a bit unfinished and missing a few bits and pieces here to there. But the program should still work as expected.
